Python IDLE with Python version 3.9.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
Database is an organized collection of data. The data is typically
organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes
requiring information. A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The train ticket booking system facilitates the passengers to enquire
about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of the
booked ticket, etc

<h3>PROJECT MOTIVE</h3>
The aim of case study is to design and develop a database
maintaining the records of different trains, train status, and
passengers. The record of train includes its number, name, source, destination, tickets can be booked, total number of seats available, and number of seats already booked. The database has been
developed and tested on MySQL
